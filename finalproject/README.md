This is my final project from Fundamentals of Computing I. I worked together with my partner, Noelle, to utilize the Xming/XQuartz server to create a program comprised of five classes we created along with a graphics class provided to us by our professor.


This program requires the use of an X11 server in order to display a graphics window.
