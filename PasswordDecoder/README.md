MD5Decoder is a python script that utilizes brute-force and parallel processing to decode MD5 cryptographic hashes into their original string. This script utilizes a -h flag to show its usage, a -a flag to select a set of characters to search for, a -c flag to specify how many CPU cores to use, a -l flag to specify the length of original passwords being search for, and a -s flag to specify which file contains the list of MD5 hashes. The hashes.txt file was provided to me by my professor Dr. Peter Bui and contains of 10,000 of the most commonly used passwords up to a length of 8 characters.

Note: Because the number possible passwords is the size of the alphabet to the power of the specified length, passwords up to length 4 are decoded almost instantly with only one core but passwords of length 8 could take hours even with the use of multiple cores.
